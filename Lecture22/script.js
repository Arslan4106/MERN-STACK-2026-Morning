// LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions
// 1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
// like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
// 'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
// which is about 18.2% of the world.'
// 2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
// 'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
// 3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice

// LECTURE: Introduction to Arrays
// 1. Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice.
// You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a
// variable called 'populations'
// 2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false)
// 3. Create an array called 'percentages' containing the percentages of the
// world population for these 4 population values. Use the function
// 'percentageOfWorld1' that you created earlier to compute the 4
// percentage values

// LECTURE: Basic Array Operations (Methods)
// 1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your
// choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array
// into a variable called 'neighbours'
// 2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of
// your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array
// 3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from
// the end of the array
// 4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country ‘Germany’, log to the
// console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
// 5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the
// index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to
// change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for
// 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

// LECTURE: Introduction to Objects
// 1. Create an object called 'myCountry' for a country of your choice, containing
// properties 'country', 'capital', 'language', 'population' and
// 'neighbours' (an array like we used in previous assignments)

// LECTURE: Dot vs. Bracket Notation
// 1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
// console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
// and a capital called Helsinki.'
// 2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
// decrease it by two million using brackets notation.

// Coding Challenge: 01
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.
